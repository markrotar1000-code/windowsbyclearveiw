# Clearview ICM Router

This directory is the AI/control-plane context architecture for Clearview Windows.
It does not replace application code or D1.

## Walk order

1. Read root `CLAUDE.md` for global constraints.
2. Read `.ai/STATE.md` for current architecture and migration status.
3. Read `.ai/RULES.md` and `.ai/AI-OPERATING-CONTRACT.md` for cross-cutting reasoning and runtime boundaries.
4. Identify the user's/request's business object: lead, estimate, quote, build plan, job, customer, installation, QC, or public question.
5. Route to exactly one primary workflow or specialist before loading detailed references.
6. Load only the references required by that stage.
7. Produce an inspectable output and record unresolved `VERIFY` items.
8. Commit business state through deterministic application services only.

## Primary routing map

| Need | Route |
|---|---|
| Scope a quote into an executable field plan | `workflows/build-plan/` |
| Take a website inquiry to a signed quote | `workflows/lead-to-quote/` |
| Finish, sign off and close a job | `workflows/job-closeout/` |
| Review or write customer-facing copy and graphics | `workflows/public-copy-sweep/` |
| Add or verify a GA4/GTM/Meta event | `workflows/analytics-events/` |
| Ship a change, or touch domain/mail | `workflows/deploy-check/` |
| Refresh or load the direct-mail pilot list (Command Center > Mail pilot) | `workflows/mail-pilot/` |
| Load or read the supplier's weekly permit list (Command Center > Analytics > Supplier permit list) | `workflows/supplier-permits/` |
| Diagnose a window symptom/photo | `specialists/diagnostician/` |
| Calculate or explain project pricing | `specialists/estimator/` |
| Review installation logic | `specialists/installation-reviewer/` |
| Help a homeowner decide what to do next | `specialists/customer-advisor/` |
| Analyze an internal lead | `specialists/lead-analyzer/` |
| Review internal project/field evidence | `specialists/evidence-reviewer/` |
| Summarize internal operations | `specialists/operations-copilot/` |
| Answer internal knowledge questions | `specialists/knowledge-assistant/` |
| Support future visualization workflows | `specialists/visualizer/` |

The internal routes are opt-in through the authenticated internal surface. Public `/ask` remains limited to its public specialist set.

## Load and exclusion table

| Route | Load | Do not load |
|---|---|---|
| Any workflow | its `CONTEXT.md`, then only the references it names | other workflows, specialists |
| Any specialist | its `CONTEXT.md` | workflows, `CHANGELOG.md` |
| Architecture change | `STATE.md`, `RULES.md`, `references/icm-rules.md` | `CHANGELOG.md`, old handoff entries |
| Current state | `STATE.md`, `WORKING.md` | `CHANGELOG.md` |
| History / "why" | `CHANGELOG.md`, `HANDOFF.md` | everything else |

Exclusion rule: a file not named in the route's Load column is opened only when the task proves it is needed.

## Business lifecycle

`Lead → Estimate → Quote → Build Plan → Job → Installation → QC → Closeout`

The ICM representation mirrors this lifecycle but never becomes the database of record.

## Context layers

- **Layer 0:** `CLAUDE.md` — identity and global operating contract.
- **Layer 1:** this file — routing.
- **Layer 2:** stage `CONTEXT.md` — stage contract and boundaries.
- **Layer 3:** `references/` — stable domain knowledge and authorities. Scoping a new Command Center feature → `references/command-center-gap-analysis.md`. Touching install/offline/service worker/manifest → `references/internal-pwa.md`. Changing Ask routing → `references/ask-routing.md`. Editing any context file → `references/icm-rules.md`. Why the structure is shaped this way → `references/icm-method-notes.md`. Writing or reviewing public copy, guides, or graphics → `references/public-copy-positioning.md`.
- **Layer 4:** `output/`, records, and application state — current work.

## Handoff rule

Embed the necessary result into the next stage's input/output artifact. Do not make a later stage crawl unrelated directories to reconstruct prior reasoning.

## Deterministic boundary

The AI can propose scope, classify uncertainty, select references, explain tradeoffs, and draft artifacts. Code must perform calculations, validation, persistence, authorization, versioning, state transitions, and final safety/quality gates.

Intent routing is deterministic-first. `functions/ask/_lib/icm-router.mjs` is the shared routing seam; internal routes are enabled with `surface: 'internal'`. Do not insert an AI intent-classification call ahead of this router.
