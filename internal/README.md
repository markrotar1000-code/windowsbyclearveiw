# Mark's internal quoting tool

`/internal/*` is a gated set of pages, behind `wrangler.toml`'s local dev
config here and separately configured in the Cloudflare Pages dashboard for
production. It is not part of the marketing site: it's excluded from the
sitemap and `robots.txt`, and every page carries `noindex, nofollow`.

The internal area now opens on a **Command Center** at `/internal/`: a compact,
field-friendly snapshot of recent leads, draft/finalized quote counts and value,
lead source/location summaries, and quick links into the existing screens. The
dashboard uses `/internal/api/dashboard`, a small read-only API that aggregates
D1 data server-side instead of downloading the full leads and quotes lists.

What the internal tool does: Mark logs in with one shared password, builds a
firm-price quote starting from `src/data/pricing.ts` (fully editable per line),
and gets it signed — either on-screen with a finger/mouse signature pad, or
printed and signed by hand (he confirms it back in the tool once it's actually
signed). The signed quote doubles as the contract, with the terms from
`src/data/contractTerms.ts`. A quote stays a fully editable draft — customer
info, line items, discount, everything — right up until it's signed.

## Before this works in production

Cloudflare Pages → this project → **Settings → Bindings** (not Environment
variables — D1 needs a real binding, and this stays separate from
`RESEND_API_KEY`'s Environment variables entry):

| Binding | Type | Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `QUOTES_DB` | D1 database | `clearview-quotes` (`4700b6f7-c3d8-46c9-9b19-17cf34accb84`) |
| `INTERNAL_PASSWORD` | Secret | The one password Mark keeps on his phone |
| `JOB_PHOTOS` | R2 bucket | `clearview-job-photos` (optional until set up; see "Job photo storage" below) |
| `INTERNAL_SESSION_SECRET` | Secret | A long random string — signs the login session cookie. Generate once with `openssl rand -hex 32` and never rotate it casually; rotating it logs everyone out |

Set these for **Production**, and again for **Preview** if you want to test
the tool on preview deploys. The committed `wrangler.toml` in the repo root
is **local-dev only** — it lets `wrangler d1 execute --local` and
`wrangler pages dev` simulate the database on disk. It is never read by the
real Cloudflare Pages build.

## AI Gateway for Groq and Gemini (optional)

Cloudflare AI Gateway sits between this site and Groq/Gemini and adds, in the Cloudflare
dashboard (AI → AI Gateway), request counts, token and cost totals, latency, errors, and
optional spending/rate limits. It is **off until `AI_GATEWAY_URL` is set**; nothing changes before that.

What the code guarantees (`functions/_lib/ai-gateway.mjs`, covered by `npm run test:embeddings`):

- **Customer text is not stored by the gateway.** Every call sends `cf-aig-collect-log-payload: false`,
  so only metadata (tokens, cost, status, duration, which feature) is logged. This matches the
  Ask log, which deliberately keeps no question text. Do not turn payload logging on at the
  gateway level without a decision to change that.
- **The gateway can never take Ask down.** If it is unreachable, misconfigured (401/403/404) or
  down (502/503/504) the same request goes straight to the provider.
- **No answer caching.** Ask answers depend on the conversation, photos and live pricing.
- **Provider keys travel in headers**, never in a URL (so they cannot land in a URL log).
- Covers Ask chat plus the internal lead analyzer, copilot and copilot summary (tagged by
  feature in the gateway log). Groq and Gemini fallback between providers is the app's own and is unchanged.

One-time setup (owner, free):

1. Cloudflare dashboard → AI → AI Gateway → **Create gateway** (name it `clearview`). Leave
   caching off. Leave "Authenticated gateway" off unless you also set `AI_GATEWAY_TOKEN`.
2. Copy the gateway's base URL, which looks like
   `https://gateway.ai.cloudflare.com/v1/<account id>/clearview`.
3. Pages → Settings → Environment variables (Production): `AI_GATEWAY_URL` = that URL. Redeploy.
4. Ask one question on `/ask`, then check the gateway's Logs tab shows a request with status 200
   and no prompt text. (Not tested against the real gateway yet: the Gemini path
   `/google-ai-studio/v1beta/...` follows Cloudflare's docs pattern; if the first Gemini request
   shows an error in the gateway, Ask still answers through the direct fallback.)

## Cloudflare Access sign-in (optional; replaces the shared password)

Today the Command Center has one shared password. Cloudflare Access (Zero Trust, free for small
teams; confirm the current limit on the plan page) puts a real login in front of `/internal`:
each person signs in with their own email (one-time code or Google), it can require MFA, every
sign-in is logged, and removing a person cuts them off at once.

The code side is built and **off until configured** (`functions/internal/_lib/access.mjs`). When
on, a request that carries a valid, correctly signed Access token counts as signed in. The
shared password keeps working alongside it, so turning this on cannot lock anyone out.

Owner steps (Cloudflare dashboard → Zero Trust; it asks you to pick a team name the first time):

1. Access → Applications → **Add → Self-hosted**. Domain `windowsbyclearview.com`, path
   **`internal`** (covers everything under `/internal`). Do **not** protect the whole site:
   customers must still reach `/sign`, `/api/estimate` and the public pages.
2. Policy: **Allow**, include the emails of the people who should get in (Mark, Keith). Login
   method: one-time PIN is enough. Set **session duration to 1 month** so Mark's phone is not
   asked to sign in again every day (photo uploads queue on the phone and retry if a session lapses).
3. Open the application and copy its **Application Audience (AUD) tag**.
4. Pages → Settings → Environment variables (Production): `ACCESS_TEAM_DOMAIN` = your team name
   (the part before `.cloudflareaccess.com`) and `ACCESS_AUD` = the AUD tag. Redeploy.
5. Test on Mark's phone and on a computer: sign in through the Access screen, confirm the
   dashboard, a photo upload and a quote all work.
6. Only after that works for everyone: set `ACCESS_REQUIRED` = `1` and redeploy. The shared
   password is then refused everywhere, including on the `*.pages.dev` address (which Access
   does not cover), and `INTERNAL_PASSWORD` can be deleted later. Setting `ACCESS_REQUIRED`
   without the team and AUD values is ignored, so it cannot lock anyone out by itself.

## Nightly backup and morning nudge (companion Worker)

Pages Functions cannot run on a schedule, so scheduled work lives in a small separate Worker,
`workers/ops-cron/` (`clearview-ops-cron`). It has no public URL and does two things:

- **Nightly D1 backup** (about 3:15 AM Pacific): every table and row is written as one gzip file
  `d1/YYYY-MM-DD.json.gz` to the **private** R2 bucket `clearview-db-backups`; the newest 30 are
  kept. The file is checked after writing, and a failure pushes "Database backup FAILED" to the
  phone (same ntfy channel as new-lead alerts). D1's own Time Travel still exists; this is the
  copy we control.
- **Weekday follow-up nudge** (about 8:30 AM Pacific): one push such as "3 follow-ups to do,
  1 overdue, 2 due today" that opens the follow-up list. Counts only, no names. Silent when
  nothing is due.

The bucket `clearview-db-backups` already exists. One-time deploy (needs a Cloudflare login, so
it is an owner step):

1. `cd workers/ops-cron && npx wrangler deploy` (or Cloudflare dashboard → Workers → Create →
   connect this GitHub repo, root directory `workers/ops-cron`).
2. `npx wrangler secret put LEAD_ALERT_NTFY_TOPIC` and paste the same value the Pages project
   uses. Without it the job still runs; it just cannot push.
3. Check: dashboard → Workers → `clearview-ops-cron` → Triggers → "Run" the backup cron once,
   then look for `d1/<today>.json.gz` in the bucket.

**Restoring** (only ever into a new, empty database, never over live data):
download a backup file, then
`node scripts/restore-from-backup.mjs backup.json.gz > restore.sql` and
`npx wrangler d1 execute <new-db> --remote --file restore.sql`. The script only prints SQL.
Tests prove a backup restores row for row into a fresh database.

Backups contain customer data, so the bucket must stay private (no public URL, no custom
domain). Cost: a few KB per night, far inside R2's free tier.

## Spam and abuse protection (Turnstile and rate limits)

The public lead form (`/api/estimate`) and the Ask assistant (`/ask/api/chat`, `/ask/api/handoff`)
are open to the internet. Two layers protect them, both in `functions/_lib/abuse-guard.mjs`:

1. **Rate limit, always on.** Per visitor (a hash of the IP, never the IP itself), kept in D1
   table `rate_limits`: estimate form 6 per hour; Ask chat 60 per hour; Ask handoff 10 per hour.
   Over the limit the visitor is told to call. If D1 is unavailable the limit steps aside
   rather than block anyone.
2. **Cloudflare Turnstile.** The widget exists and its public **site key** is committed in
   `src/data/site.ts` (`turnstileSiteKey`), so the check now shows on the estimate form. The
   server only *requires* a token once the **secret key** is added as the Pages secret
   `TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY` (Production and Preview), then redeploy. Until then the widget is
   cosmetic and nothing is refused. Add it with
   `npx wrangler pages secret put TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY --project-name <pages-project>` (paste the
   secret when asked; do not put it in chat or the repo) or in the dashboard under Settings →
   Variables and Secrets. The widget's allowed hostnames must include `windowsbyclearview.com`
   (and `www.` if used), or the check fails on the live site. If Cloudflare's verifier cannot be
   reached the lead is let through (a lost lead costs more than one bot message).

Mark should still see the real leads: test by sending one estimate request after enabling.

## Job photo storage (Cloudflare R2)

Photos Mark takes on his phone (Photos tool, `/internal/tools/photos`) are saved on the
phone first and then backed up to a **private R2 bucket**, so a lost, reset or full phone no
longer loses the job record, and the same photos show up on any device he signs in on.
Nothing is public: the bucket has no public URL, and every photo is served through
`/internal/api/job-photos`, which needs the Command Center login.

**Until the steps below are done, nothing breaks.** The Photos page says "Not connected yet",
photos stay on the phone exactly as before, and they upload on their own (oldest first) the
first time the phone is online after storage is connected.

One-time setup, in the Cloudflare dashboard:

1. **Enable R2** for the account (R2 object storage → get started). Cloudflare may ask for a
   payment method; the free tier below is expected to cover this use.
2. **Create a bucket** named `clearview-job-photos` (leave public access off).
3. Pages → this project → **Settings → Bindings → Add → R2 bucket**: variable name
   **`JOB_PHOTOS`**, bucket `clearview-job-photos`. Add it for **Production** (and **Preview**
   if you test on preview deploys), then **redeploy** so the binding takes effect.

Design notes:

- **What is stored.** The phone shrinks each photo to at most 2000 px on the long edge (JPEG,
  roughly 0.3 to 1.5 MB instead of 5 to 12 MB) before uploading and keeps the original on the
  phone. The server accepts only JPEG, PNG and WebP, decided from the file's own bytes, up to
  8 MB. Objects live at `jobs/<job id>/<photo id>.<ext>` (ids made by the server, never the file
  name); one row per photo in the D1 table `job_photos` (created on first use) holds the job,
  opening, stage, note and the phone's own photo id.
- **Retries are safe.** The phone sends its own photo id with every upload, and the server
  returns the existing photo instead of storing a second copy.
- **Deleting.** Deleting a photo that is backed up removes it from the phone and from R2. "Clear
  this phone's photos for this job" only frees phone storage; cloud copies are kept.
- **Cost (Cloudflare's published R2 pricing, checked 2026-09-30).** Free each month: 10 GB of
  storage, 1 million writes, 10 million reads; above that $0.015 per GB-month, and no charge for
  downloads. At about 1 MB per photo the free storage holds several thousand photos.
- **What this does not do yet.** The server-side Photograph gate in Field mode still trusts the
  photo counts the phone reports; it does not yet count the photos stored in R2. Photos taken on
  a second phone do show in the Photos tool, but Field mode's own photo counts are read from the
  phone you are holding.
- **Local development.** `wrangler pages dev dist --r2 JOB_PHOTOS` simulates the bucket on disk.

## Analytics (internal `/internal/analytics` page)

The page shows three things. **Requests to revenue** counts the last 90 days of
estimate requests, quotes, signatures, jobs and payments straight from D1 (no
setup), plus stale drafts and finalized quotes still waiting on a job. Those totals
are separate counts. Below them, **Which sources bring paying work** follows
quotes linked to a website inquiry (set by *Start quote*, or by clicking a
suggested match on the quote page) through to signature and payment. **Where leads came from** is counted from the
first-touch attribution already stored on each lead in D1, so it works with no
setup. **Site traffic** comes from the Google Analytics 4 Data API through
`functions/internal/api/analytics.js` and is optional: until it is configured the
page says "Not connected" and everything else keeps working. Google Tag Manager
only collects data (it has no reports), so its numbers are the GA4 numbers.
Ahrefs is a link only, because Ahrefs Webmaster Tools (the free plan) has no API.

Setup, in order (needs Google Cloud, GA4 and Cloudflare access):

1. **Find the GA4 property ID.** GA4 -> Admin -> Property settings -> *Property ID*
   (a number such as `123456789`). It is **not** the `G-YE96XMJSWJ` measurement ID.
2. **Enable the API.** Google Cloud Console (any project) -> APIs & Services ->
   enable **Google Analytics Data API**.
3. **Create a service account.** IAM & Admin -> Service accounts -> create
   `clearview-analytics-reader`. It needs no project roles.
4. **Create a key.** That account -> Keys -> Add key -> JSON. If the organization
   blocks key creation (policy `iam.disableServiceAccountKeyCreation`), stop and
   ask Keith; do not work around it.
5. **Grant read access in GA4.** GA4 -> Admin -> Property access management -> add
   the service account's email as **Viewer**.
6. **Store the credentials.** Cloudflare Pages -> this project -> Settings ->
   Variables and Secrets (Production):

| Variable | Type | Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GA4_PROPERTY_ID` | Text | The numeric property ID from step 1 |
| `GA4_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON` | Secret | The whole downloaded JSON key file, pasted as-is |

7. **Redeploy**, sign in, open `/internal/analytics`; the Site traffic panel should
   read **Connected**. Then delete the downloaded key file from your machine. The
   key must never be committed to the repo or pasted into chat.

The service account can only read analytics (scope `analytics.readonly`). If the
panel shows "Unavailable" after setup, the usual causes are the account not yet
added as Viewer, the Data API not enabled, or a wrong property ID.

## Permit leads (Analytics page, public records)

The **Permit leads** section of `/internal/analytics` shows building permits from
Clark County and the City of Vancouver, joined to county assessor parcels and WA L&I
contractor licenses. It is research data in three tables (`permit_prospects`,
`permit_builders`, `permit_import_meta`, created on first use), not leads: nothing in
them is a customer, quote or job until a person acts on it.

Refresh it (about 15 seconds, no credentials; every source is a public endpoint):

```bash
npm run build:permit-leads                       # last 183 days -> data/permit-leads/
npm run build:permit-leads -- --since=2026-04-02 # or an explicit start date
npx wrangler d1 execute QUOTES_DB --remote --file=data/permit-leads/permit-leads.sql
```

(`--remote` from the repo root uses the id in `wrangler.toml`, which is not the production database; use the scratch
config described under "Which database" in the Mail pilot section below. Production held no permit data on 2026-10-08.)

The SQL file replaces the whole snapshot (it deletes and re-inserts), so run it as
often as you like. The page shows when the data was loaded and its date window.
`prospects.csv` and `builders.csv` in the same folder hold the same rows for a
spreadsheet.

**Privacy.** `data/permit-leads/` is git-ignored because it holds owner names and
mailing addresses and this repository is public. Never commit it or paste it into
chat. The list of homeowner rows is a separate request the page only makes when you
press "Show the list", and both endpoints sit behind the session gate like every
`/internal` route. Use the owner mailing address for mail. Washington's 2022
telephone-solicitation law restricts unsolicited calls and texts, and these records
carry no phone numbers for homeowners (none are guessed). The separate
Supplier permit list below does carry owner phones, copied from a licensed report; see its privacy note.

**What the numbers mean**

- *New-home permits* (case types NHC/SFR, issued): rolled up to the **lot owner**
  from the parcel record, because the permit applicant is often a permit service or an
  engineer. A builder row's license is a match on the **exact** business name (lot
  owner first, then applicant). "None found" is not proof of no license: out-of-state
  builders often license under another name. A match on a person's name is labelled
  "name match, verify".
- *Remodel and addition permits*: "fit" is the count (0 to 5) of equal-weight
  signals: single-family home, owner applied, addition, permit in the last 90 days,
  sold in the last 2 years. It is a sort order, not a probability or a price.
- Same-size window replacements usually need no permit in Vancouver, so permit data
  finds new builds and remodels, not most simple replacement jobs.
- Dates after today are dropped as county typos (the data has a few in 2029 and 2039).

Sources: permits and parcels from `gis.clark.wa.gov` (ArcGIS REST), licenses from
data.wa.gov dataset `m8qx-ubtq`. Tests: `npm run test:permit-leads`.

## Supplier permit list (Analytics page, licensed weekly report)

The **Supplier permit list** section of `/internal/analytics` shows the weekly permit report Mark's supplier shares
(Construction Monitor: Portland, Vancouver and Salem metro), joined to Clark County parcels, sales and WA L&I contractor
licenses and compared with the Permit leads and Mail pilot lists. It is research data in two tables (`supplier_permits`,
`supplier_import_meta`, created by the SQL file itself), not leads: nothing in them is a customer, quote or job until a
person acts on it. With nothing loaded the section says "No supplier list loaded yet".

Each week, from the new PDF (steps and rules: `.ai/workflows/supplier-permits/CONTEXT.md`):

```bash
pip install pdfplumber                           # once
python3 scripts/supplier-permits/parse-construction-monitor.py REPORT.pdf --out ../private/wk41.json
npm run build:permit-leads                       # refresh the list the report is compared with (optional)
npm run build:supplier-permits -- --in=../private/wk41.json --mail-pilot=../private/properties.json
# -> data/supplier-permits/supplier-permits.sql and .csv; the terminal shows counts only
```

Then load the SQL into the production database exactly as described under "Which database" in the Mail pilot section
below (scratch config, Mark's account id, `--file=data/supplier-permits/supplier-permits.sql`). Check before and after with
`--command "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM supplier_permits"`.

**Loading is a merge, not a replace.** Rows are keyed by the report's permit number. A permit seen again is refreshed in
place and keeps its `first_seen`; new permits are added; permits missing from a later report are left alone; nothing is
deleted; running the same file twice leaves the same rows; an older file loaded after a newer one does not overwrite it.
Each weekly report therefore adds to the table.

**The parser** reads the report's three-column layout by position (font, colour, indent) and checks itself against the
report's own week totals: if the permits it found do not add up to the totals on page 2 it writes nothing. It is not part
of CI (it needs a licensed report to run), so a new report layout shows up as that failure, not as silently wrong data.

**What is joined, and how sure it is**

- *County parcel*: by the permit's county case number when the county has the permit (the permit carries its property id),
  otherwise by street address. One exact street match is used ("address exact"); one near match is "address close"; several
  parcels at one address are left unmatched ("ambiguous") rather than guessed. Permits with no street, or on a brand-new lot
  the assessor does not list yet, have no parcel facts.
- *Owner and phone*: names and phone numbers are copied from the report; the assessor's owner and mailing address are shown
  next to them ("owner lives elsewhere" compares the mailing address with the site; "owner differs from county record" flags
  a sale the county has not caught up with). No phone number is looked up or guessed.
- *Contractor license*: exact business-name match (ignoring punctuation and LLC/INC) to an active L&I license. The license number the report prints is kept
  as printed and is a separate column. "None found" is not proof of no license.
- *Already in our lists*: same case number, else same street, in Permit leads; same case or street in the Mail pilot. A
  builder is "already tracked" when the whole company name matches a Permit leads builder (the report cuts long names off,
  so a cut-off name matches only when it is long enough to be unambiguous); "HSR 124 LLC" next to a tracked "HSR 121 LLC" is
  shown as "Check", never as a match.
- *Metro rank*: the builder's place in the report's year-to-date single-family builder ranking, matched by the start of
  the name. Rows for two LLCs of one company add up.
- *Fit* (0 to 5, remodel, ADU and re-roof permits only): single-family home, no contractor named, addition or ADU, permit in
  the last 90 days, sold in the last 2 years. Equal weights; a sort order, not a probability or a price.

**Privacy and licence.** The report is licensed to one subscriber and forbids sharing, owners' names, mailing addresses and
phone numbers are in it, and this repository is public. So the PDF and the parsed JSON stay outside the repo (the parser
refuses any output folder inside it except `data/`), `data/supplier-permits/` is git-ignored (the build refuses any other
folder in the repo), and nothing from the report belongs in chat, issues or screenshots. The page's counts, charts and builder
table come from a summary request with no owner data; the list and the spreadsheet are separate requests, behind the session
gate, `private, no-store`, never cached by the service worker. The spreadsheet escapes cells that could be read as formulas.
Owner phone numbers are shown as plain text on purpose: Washington restricts unsolicited calls and texts, so use mail for
homeowners and phone only people who asked to hear from us.

**Counties.** Only Clark County permits are enriched (the county publishes parcels and sales for free). Oregon permits in
the same report are skipped, not half-enriched.

Sources: the supplier's weekly PDF; `gis.clark.wa.gov` (permits, assessor parcels, recorded sales); data.wa.gov dataset
`m8qx-ubtq` (licenses). Tests: `npm run test:supplier-permits`.

## Mail pilot (`/internal/mail-pilot`, direct mail from public records)

A test of mailing postcards to Clark County homes that just sold or pulled a re-roof or remodel permit.
The page (Command Center > Tools > Mail pilot) shows the list at a glance, four charts, the suggested way to
run the test, a break-even box and the mailing list with a mail-merge CSV. It is research data in two tables
(`mail_pilot_properties`, `mail_pilot_meta`, created on first use), not leads: nothing in them is a customer
until a person acts on it. With nothing loaded the page says so instead of failing.

Refresh it from a properties file (row fields: `.ai/workflows/mail-pilot/CONTEXT.md`):

```bash
npm run build:mail-pilot -- --in=/path/to/properties.json --pulled=2026-10-08   # -> data/mail-pilot/mail-pilot.sql
```

then load it into the production database (next paragraph for the command).

**Which database.** Production D1 lives in Mark's Cloudflare account (database `clearveiw-quotes`; its id is under
Storage & databases > D1 in the dashboard). The `database_id` in the repo's `wrangler.toml` is for local development
only and is a different database (checked 2026-10-08), so `--remote` from the repo root does not reach production.
Load with a scratch config outside the repo that names the production id, and pick Mark's account (its Account ID is
listed by `npx wrangler whoami`):

```bash
# scratch/wrangler.toml
#   name = "mail-pilot-load"
#   [[d1_databases]]
#   binding = "QUOTES_DB"
#   database_name = "clearveiw-quotes"
#   database_id = "<production id from the dashboard>"
CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID=<Mark's account id> npx wrangler d1 execute QUOTES_DB --remote --config scratch/wrangler.toml --file=data/mail-pilot/mail-pilot.sql -y
```

Check a first look before and after with `--command "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM mail_pilot_properties"`. On 2026-10-08 the
first load wrote 528 homes (CV-0001 to CV-0528).

The build prints how many homes landed in each group so you can check it before loading. Optional flags:
`--min-price=50000` and `--cutoff-year=1995` change the two numbers in the group rules; `--out=` must stay
inside `data/` or outside the repo.

**Loading is a merge, not a replace.** Each home has a reference code (`CV-0001`, ...) that is printed on its
mail, so a later load never changes or reuses a code: known homes are updated in place, new homes get the next
code, homes missing from a newer pull are left as they were. Running the same file twice leaves the same rows and codes. Money
is stored in integer cents.

**Privacy.** `data/mail-pilot/` is git-ignored because it holds street addresses and this repository is public.
Never commit it or paste it into chat; the build refuses to write anywhere else inside the repo. The page's
numbers and charts come from a summary request that contains no addresses; the address list and the CSV are
separate requests, both behind the session gate and sent with `cache-control: private, no-store`, and the
service worker never caches them. Homes are addressed to "CURRENT RESIDENT": the county data names no buyer.
The CSV escapes cells that could be read as spreadsheet formulas.

**What the groups mean** (one set of rules, `functions/internal/_lib/mail-pilot.mjs`, used by the loader, the
page and the tests; a permit outranks a sale)

| Group | Rule | Plan |
|---|---|---|
| A | Re-roof permit issued | Wave 1 |
| B | Remodel or addition permit issued (the county does not say what the work is) | Wave 1 |
| C | Sold at 50,000 dollars or more on a market-style deed, no permit, built in or before 1995 | Wave 1 |
| D | Same as C but built after 1995, or year unknown | Optional later batch, to see whether home age changes response |
| E | Quitclaim, probate, trust transfer, or no sale price | Hold |

These are sorting rules, not a prediction that a household wants windows.

**Measuring it.** The estimate link for each piece is `/estimate?utm_source=mailer&utm_medium=print&utm_campaign=CV-####`
(`trackingLink` in `src/lib/mail-pilot.ts`). The site already records `utm_source`, `utm_medium` and `utm_campaign`
on a visitor's first touch, the same way the `/neighbors` door-hanger link does, so a request shows its code in
Leads. That has not yet been confirmed end to end in production: check the first real request. Phone callers
should be asked for the code on their card. The break-even box takes pieces mailed, cost per piece, average
signed job, profit percent and (optionally) close rate, all typed in; Clearview's real figures are not stored
anywhere and nothing is prefilled.

**County lag.** The county posts sales weeks after they close, so the newest weeks of any pull are incomplete
(the "Homes sold per week" chart shows it). Re-pull about six weeks after the window and load again.

districts. Tests: `npm run test:mail-pilot`.

## Google reviews feed (public `/reviews` page)

`functions/api/google-reviews.js` serves the pinned Google Business Profile's
reviews to `/reviews`. It is optional: with nothing configured it returns
`{ status: "unconfigured" }` and the page keeps its owner-supplied review cards.
Hali Kimball's five-star review was transcribed from the owner's screenshot on
2026-10-06. The dated Google summary is 5.0 from two reviews. No customer city
or absolute posting date was inferred. When the feed returns the same author
and quote, the matching static card is hidden to avoid displaying it twice;
other curated reviews remain visible.

Cloudflare Pages -> this project -> **Settings -> Variables and Secrets**:

| Variable | Type | Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY` | Secret | Google Cloud key, restricted to **Places API (New)** only |
| `GOOGLE_PLACE_ID` | Text | Place ID of *Clearview windows and trim LLC*. Find it with `GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY=... npm run find:google-place-id` (matches on phone number, not just name) |
| `GOOGLE_PLACE_EXPECTED_NAME` | Text, optional | Defaults to `Clearview windows and trim LLC`. If Google returns a different name for the Place ID, the feed shows nothing |
| `GOOGLE_REVIEWS_TTL_SECONDS` | Text, optional | Edge cache for good responses. Default 21600 (6 h), clamped 300-86400 |

Notes: the Places API returns at most the 5 most relevant reviews, not all of
them. Reviews are shown as written with Google attribution, and no
`aggregateRating` / review schema is emitted (Google treats self-serving review
markup as ineligible). Places API content has caching limits in Google's terms,
so keep the TTL short-ish; the compliant way to show *every* review later is the
Business Profile API with owner OAuth (Keith manages the profile), which needs
Google's API access approval.

## Install on a phone, and offline use

The Command Center is an installable app (PWA). Design and limits: `.ai/references/internal-pwa.md`.

- **Android (Chrome):** open `/internal/tools`, **Phone app** card, **Install app** (or the browser menu, Add to Home screen).
- **iPhone / iPad (Safari):** Share, **Add to Home Screen**. The installed app has its **own storage and sign-in**:
  it asks for the password once, and photos taken in Safari do not show up in it. Until R2 photo backup is connected
  (see "Job photo storage"), photos exist only on the phone, so connect R2 first or keep taking photos in Safari.
- **Offline:** after signing in, the app saves the main pages and today's jobs and follow-ups, including what Field
  mode reads for each active job. With no signal those open from the saved copy (banner at the top says so);
  saved data expires after 3 days. Photos still save to the phone. **Anything that changes a record (checklist,
  evidence, approvals, quotes, invoices, payments) needs a connection and is never saved for later.**
- **Updates:** nothing to do. After each deploy the installed app picks up the new version by itself the next time it is opened or brought to the front, and refreshes its saved pages. A page with typed-in, unsaved text is never reloaded under you; a banner offers Reload instead. Tools, Phone app card, shows the running version and has **Check for updates**.
- **Photo backup:** the Phone app card has a line that says whether cloud photo backup is connected and how many photos on this
  phone are not backed up yet. If it says "NOT connected", those photos exist only on that phone: finish the R2 steps in "Job photo
  storage" above (the bucket and the `JOB_PHOTOS` binding on the Pages project that serves the site).
- **Something looks wrong on a phone?** Tools, Phone app card, **Copy diagnostics**, then paste into a message. It holds versions,
  counts and event names, no customer data.
- **Control:** Tools, Phone app card: **Save pages for offline** (refresh now), **Clear saved data** (pages and data;
  photos are untouched). Logging out clears saved data.
- **Sign-in:** production sits behind Cloudflare Access. When the Access session ends, the app shows "Your session ended" with
  a Sign in link, drops all saved data, and Access signs you in again. The Access session length you set (1 month) is how long
  the app works without a sign-in. On an iPhone, check that this sign-in completes inside the installed app; if it loops,
  keep using Safari for the Command Center and tell Keith.
- Nothing to configure in Cloudflare for the app itself. The worker and manifest are plain files in `public/`.

## Local development

```bash
npm run build
npx wrangler d1 execute QUOTES_DB --local --file=internal/db/schema.sql
npx wrangler pages dev dist \
  --d1 QUOTES_DB=4700b6f7-c3d8-46c9-9b19-17cf34accb84 \
  -b INTERNAL_PASSWORD=devpassword \
  -b INTERNAL_SESSION_SECRET=devsecret \
  --ai AI
```

`--ai AI` binds Workers AI for the `/ask` photo-analysis feature — it proxies to
the real Cloudflare API, so it needs `wrangler login` to actually return a result
locally; without login it fails gracefully (see the main README's `/ask` section).

`npx astro dev`/`astro preview` do **not** run Pages Functions, so `/internal/*`
will 404 or fail to authenticate under those — use `wrangler pages dev` for
anything touching `/internal/`.

## Schema changes

Edit `internal/db/schema.sql`, then apply it to both copies by hand:

```bash
npx wrangler d1 execute QUOTES_DB --local --file=internal/db/schema.sql
npx wrangler d1 execute QUOTES_DB --remote --file=internal/db/schema.sql
```

There's no migration runner — this is a two-table schema for one internal
user, and a migration framework would be more code than the thing it's
guarding.

## Known gaps, on purpose

- **No attorney review.** `src/data/contractTerms.ts` has a warning at the
top. The right-to-cancel language follows the FTC Cooling-Off Rule model
language, but it has not been checked by a Washington attorney. Do not
treat the printed contract as legally bulletproof until someone has.
- **No edit-after-finalize.** A draft quote (built but not yet signed —
either path) can be edited freely from its "Edit quote" link. Once it's
finalized (a digital signature attached, or a printed copy confirmed
signed), there is no UI or API path to change it — a mistake at that
point means starting a new quote. This is deliberate: a signed contract
shouldn't be silently editable.
- **Single shared password.** There's no per-user login, audit log of who
created which quote, or password reset flow. Fine for one person (Mark);
revisit if a second person needs access.

### Website buying intent (2026-10-09)

GTM-WGCFVHQM sends fixed `cv_intent` action names to G-YE96XMJSWJ. URLs and referrers exclude query strings; contact fields and internal browser IDs stay out of GA4. Duplicate generated GA4 bridge tags are paused.

Additional browser action counters expire after 90 days and honor GPC/DNT. Submitted leads carry bounded, allowlisted activity into `leads.intent_json`; the Leads page shows browser visits, signals and a deterministic engagement score. It is a reading aid, not purchase likelihood or a trigger for automated contact. Shared devices, blocked storage and altered browser data limit reliability. Older leads remain without a score.

Analytics shows a 28-day action chart when the existing GA4 read-only service account is configured. Use calculator starts/results/handoffs and form starts/attempts/errors to locate drop-offs. Compare submitted requests to signed quotes and collected payments in the existing D1 pipeline. Phone clicks measure interest, not completed calls. Keep conversions limited to confirmed submissions.

## Google operations tools

`/internal/google-tools` is available from Tools. Connections stay off until configured and live-tested. API enablement alone does not prove access. All credentials below are server-side Cloudflare Pages secrets; ordinary IDs are environment variables. Never commit keys or customer documents.

| Connection | Configuration and access |
| --- | --- |
| Search Console | `GOOGLE_SEARCH_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON` (or existing `GA4_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON`), `GOOGLE_SEARCH_SITE` defaults to `sc-domain:windowsbyclearview.com`. Enable Search Console API and grant that service-account email restricted access to the verified property. Uses only `webmasters.readonly`. |
| Address, routes, weather | Separate `GOOGLE_MAPS_OPERATIONS_KEY`, restricted to Address Validation API, Routes API and Weather API. Enable those APIs with billing; do not expand the existing Places-only key. Server requests pass the key in a header. Confirm each service live before calling it connected. |
| Receipt parser and label OCR | `GOOGLE_DOCUMENT_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON`; enable Document AI API and Cloud Vision API. Assign minimum Document AI API User access and required Service Usage Consumer access. `GOOGLE_DOCUMENT_PROCESSOR` is the exact regional resource of an Expense Parser or Invoice Parser, e.g. projects/project-id/locations/us/processors/processor-id. Expense Parser suits receipts; Invoice Parser adds invoice fields. These are distinct processors, so choose one and test representative documents. No model-generated result becomes a confirmed job fact. |
| Business Profile metrics | `GOOGLE_OWNER_OAUTH_JSON` containing client_id, client_secret, refresh_token; `GOOGLE_BUSINESS_LOCATION` is locations/numeric-id. Business Profile Performance API and Google project approval may be required. Owner grants `business.manage` (Google offers no equivalent narrow read-only scope). Application code only reads metrics/reviews. |
| Business Profile review feed | Same owner OAuth; `GOOGLE_BUSINESS_REVIEW_LOCATION` is accounts/numeric-id/locations/numeric-id. Google My Business API v4 access requires approval and may be unavailable while pending. This internal feed does not replace the public Places review panel. |
| Calendar | Same owner OAuth with `calendar.events.owned` for an owned calendar; `GOOGLE_CALENDAR_ID` selects the calendar explicitly. Enable Calendar API. Do not grant full calendar/account access. App only reads events and creates appointments after an operator confirms the title and times. Google OAuth testing mode can expire refresh tokens after seven days; use an appropriate production/internal consent configuration and verify refresh. |

Create/authorize credentials only after the owner confirms the concrete roles/scopes and destination. Store credentials in production Pages secrets, not browser code or analytics. Restrict billing quotas in Google Cloud as an additional control; budget alerts alone are not hard spending caps. The app's D1 daily attempt caps are 10 each for receipt/OCR/calendar-create and 50 each for other actions. No Google call runs automatically on page load. Files are one explicitly selected JPEG/PNG (or PDF for receipts), maximum 2 MiB; Document AI processes only page 1 to bound page charges, and no upload is persisted. Multi-page invoice totals may be missing; always review the original. Reading an image transmits it to Google.

Reviewed expenses live in lazy-created `google_expenses` with integer USD cents, date, supplier and optional existing job reference. No supplier payments or accounting reconciliation. Google output and raw receipts are not stored. `google_tool_usage` stores only UTC day/action/count. Saved request IDs prevent duplicate expense records; calendar conflicts are compared with the original event. Calendar sends no invitations and does not reschedule a job. Maps results are ephemeral, attributed, and never silently replace an address. Route ordering does not model appointment time windows; weather never clears an installation safety gate.

Verification: `npm run test:google-tools` exercises real handlers/SQLite, quota exhaustion, same-origin/auth gates, scopes, document validation and calendar conflict handling. Follow `.ai/references/google-operations.md`, the full deploy check and a live synthetic test for every connected service. Browser/account access pending is VERIFY, not completion.
